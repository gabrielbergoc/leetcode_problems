# leetcode_problems
Hi :)

These are some leetcode problems I solved in October-2020 when I had finished part 2 of Coursera's Introduction to Computer Science with Python (by USP) and wanted to keep learning.

The first problem I tried was actually about linked lists, and since I was a beginner, I had so much headache trying to figure it out that after some days, I ended up looking up the solution. I certainly learned a lot with it, but didn't upload it, because it wasn't my solution after all. I soon moved to easy problems, as I felt these would be more helpful to me as a beginner (there are actually 52 easy problems I took, and didn't upload them for now, because I still need to revise the code and check if it's legible and it was all actually wrote by me).

Most of these solutions was implemented by me, unless stated otherwise (I had a habit of working to get to a working solution, and then looking up for other solutions, and if I found these interesting and/or instructing, I would copy and paste them to my files)

* Disclaimer: since it's been 6 months I wrote these codes, it is possible that I forget if I actually wrote some of them. I am doing my best to remember which ones I wrote and comment the ones I didn't, so as to not try to show someone else's code as my own.
